/// [200. Number of Islands](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-islands/description/?envType=problem-list-v2&envId=oizxjoit)
/// Medium
/// Given an m x n 2D binary grid grid which represents a map of '1's (land) and '0's (water), return the number of islands.
///
/// An island is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.
///
///
///
/// Example 1:
///
/// Input: grid = [
///   ["1","1","1","1","0"],
///   ["1","1","0","1","0"],
///   ["1","1","0","0","0"],
///   ["0","0","0","0","0"]
/// ]
/// Output: 1
/// Example 2:
///
/// Input: grid = [
///   ["1","1","0","0","0"],
///   ["1","1","0","0","0"],
///   ["0","0","1","0","0"],
///   ["0","0","0","1","1"]
/// ]
/// Output: 3
///
///
/// Constraints:
///
/// m == grid.length
/// n == grid[i].length
/// 1 <= m, n <= 300
/// grid[i][j] is '0' or '1'.
